# Pure CSS Tables 

### Requirements:
- Implementation should be responsive, use bootstrap if needed.
- The smallest screen it should work on is 320px. You don’t need to build above for smaller screens.
- Feel free to use any text and images, any font and size. You don't have to use the one from the screenshot. Entire row should be clickable.
- Add a “Compose” button on bottom right. This button should be floating, i.e. visible even with scrolling.
